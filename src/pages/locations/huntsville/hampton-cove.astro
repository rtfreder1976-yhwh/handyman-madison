            Hampton Cove represents the best of Huntsville living—championship
            golf, proximity to Monte Sano State Park, excellent schools, and a
            true sense of community. This master-planned development has grown
            from its 1990s origins into one of North Alabama's most sought-after
            addresses.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            We understand what makes Hampton Cove special. From the luxury homes
            of The Ledges overlooking the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail to the
            family-friendly neighborhoods near Hampton Cove Elementary, each
            area has unique characteristics and maintenance needs. The mature
            trees that make Hampton Cove beautiful also mean more gutter
            cleaning, and those spacious decks need regular maintenance to stay
            pristine.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            Whether you're a golf enthusiast in The Ledges, a young family in
            Hampton Station, or you've lived here since the beginning, we're
            here to help with all your home repair and improvement needs. We
            treat every Hampton Cove home with the care and precision this
            community deserves.
