            Harvest represents the best of North Alabama living—affordable homes, good schools, friendly neighbors, and easy access to Huntsville's jobs and amenities. Named for its agricultural heritage, this unincorporated community has grown from rural farmland into one of the region's most desirable addresses.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Today's Harvest blends country charm with suburban convenience. You'll find established farmhouses on spacious lots alongside modern subdivisions filled with young families. Many residents commute to Redstone Arsenal, Cummings Research Park, or Huntsville while enjoying Harvest's lower cost of living and tight-knit community feel.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            Based just 10 minutes away in Madison, Harvest is practically our backyard. We serve your community with the same care we'd give our own neighbors—because many of you are our neighbors. Whether you have a newer home needing finishing touches or an established property requiring updates, we deliver quality work at fair prices.

We understand the unique needs of country properties—larger lots, outbuildings, well and septic systems, gravel drives, and the self-reliant spirit of rural homeowners. When we give you a quote, we account for actual conditions, not assumptions. When we schedule a job, we show up ready to work.</p>
