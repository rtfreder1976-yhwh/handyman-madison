          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Somerville holds a special place in Alabama history. Founded in 1819 and serving as the Morgan County seat since 1891, this small town of around 700 residents maintains the authentic Southern charm that larger cities have lost. The historic courthouse square, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, anchors a community where neighbors know each other and heritage matters.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Beyond the town square, rural Morgan County spreads across farms, forests, and country homes where families have lived for generations. These properties require contractors who understand rural life—larger lots, outbuildings, well and septic systems, and the self-reliant spirit of country living. Many newer residents have discovered Somerville's affordable land and peaceful lifestyle while commuting to jobs in Decatur or Huntsville.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            Based 35 minutes away in Madison, we're committed to serving Somerville and rural Morgan County. We understand that finding reliable contractors in small towns can be challenging—many won't make the drive or treat rural customers as a priority. We're different. When we schedule a job in Somerville, we show up on time, do quality work, and treat your property with respect.

You can't hide behind a big company name or move on to the next neighborhood if you do poor work. We understand that serving Somerville means building relationships, not just completing jobs. When we work on your home, we know we might see you at the grocery store next week. That accountability makes us better contractors.</p>
