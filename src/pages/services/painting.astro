const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to paint a room?",
    answer: "A standard 12x12 room typically costs $300-500 for walls and ceiling with quality paint. Factors affecting price include room size, ceiling height, number of colors, surface condition, and trim painting. We provide free detailed estimates so you know exactly what to expect."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to paint a room?",
    answer: "A single room usually takes 1 day including prep, painting, and cleanup. Larger rooms, multiple colors, or extensive prep work may take 2 days. Whole house interiors typically take 3-5 days depending on size and scope."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to buy the paint?",
    answer: "You can, but most customers prefer we handle it. We get contractor pricing at major paint stores and can recommend the right products for your project. We pass our discounts on to you. Just tell us your color choices."
  },
  {
    question: "What paint brands do you use?",
    answer: "We use premium paints from Sherwin-Williams, Benjamin Moore, and Behr. We recommend specific products based on the surface, room usage, and your budget. Quality paint costs more but lasts longer and looks better."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I choose the right paint color?",
    answer: "We can help! We bring color samples and discuss what works with your lighting, furniture, and style. We recommend testing colors on your wall before committing. Many paint stores offer small sample sizes for testing."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to move my furniture?",
    answer: "We handle furniture moving as part of our service. We'll move items to the center of the room and cover them with plastic. For large or valuable pieces, we may ask you to remove them beforehand."
  },
  {
    question: "How long before I can use the room after painting?",
    answer: "You can typically use the room the same evening for light use. Avoid touching walls for 24 hours and wait 2-4 weeks before washing painted surfaces. We'll give you specific care instructions for your paint."
  },
  {
    question: "What about the paint smell?",
    answer: "Modern paints are low-VOC and have minimal odor. We ventilate rooms during and after painting. Most smell dissipates within 24-48 hours. If you're sensitive to odors, we can recommend zero-VOC options."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you paint over wallpaper?",
    answer: "We can, but we usually recommend removing it for best results. Painting over wallpaper can show seams and texture. We offer wallpaper removal services and can advise on the best approach for your situation."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer exterior painting in winter?",
    answer: "Exterior painting requires temperatures above 50°F for proper curing. In North Alabama, we typically paint exteriors March through November. For winter projects, we focus on interior painting."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I repaint my house exterior?",
    answer: "Quality exterior paint in Alabama typically lasts 7-10 years. Factors like sun exposure, paint quality, and surface preparation affect longevity. We use premium paints and proper prep to maximize paint life."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer emergency painting services?",
    answer: "Yes, for situations like preparing a home for sale, move-in deadlines, or covering damage quickly, we offer expedited scheduling. Call us directly to discuss urgent painting needs."
