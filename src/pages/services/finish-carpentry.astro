const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How much does crown molding installation cost?",
    answer: "Crown molding typically costs $8-15 per linear foot installed, depending on the profile size and complexity. A typical room (50 linear feet) runs $400-750. Multi-piece crown assemblies and custom work cost more. We provide free detailed estimates."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between MDF and wood trim?",
    answer: "MDF (medium-density fiberboard) is more affordable, doesn't warp, and paints beautifully — ideal for painted trim. Solid wood (pine, oak, poplar) costs more but can be stained to show natural grain. We recommend MDF for most painted applications."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you match my existing trim style?",
    answer: "Usually, yes. We can match most standard profiles or have custom trim milled to match older or unique styles. Bring us a sample or photos and we'll find a solution."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does baseboard installation take?",
    answer: "A typical room takes 2-4 hours. A whole house (average 200 linear feet) usually takes 1-2 days including removing old baseboards, installation, and caulking."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you paint or stain the trim?",
    answer: "We can! We offer primed trim ready for paint, or we can paint/stain as part of the project. Many customers prefer pre-primed MDF that we install and then paint after caulking."
  },
  {
    question: "What is coping and why does it matter?",
    answer: "Coping is a cutting technique for inside corners that creates tighter joints than simple miter cuts. As walls shift over time, coped joints stay tight while mitered joints can gap. We cope all inside corners for lasting results."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you add trim to a room that has none?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Adding baseboards, crown molding, and door/window casings transforms a basic room into a finished, polished space. It's one of the best value-add improvements for any home."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you install wainscoting?",
    answer: "Yes! We install all styles: beadboard, raised panel, flat panel, board and batten, and shiplap. Wainscoting adds character, protects walls, and increases home value."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle corners that aren't square?",
    answer: "Older homes often have out-of-square walls. We use techniques like back-cutting, scribing, and flexible caulk to achieve tight-fitting trim even on imperfect walls."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you build custom bookcases or built-ins?",
    answer: "Yes! We design and build custom shelving, bookcases, window seats, and entertainment centers. Built-ins maximize space and add significant value to your home."
