const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How much does crown molding installation cost?",
    answer:
      "Crown molding typically costs $8-15 per linear foot installed, depending on the profile size and complexity. A typical room (50 linear feet) runs $400-750. Multi-piece crown assemblies and custom work cost more. We provide free detailed estimates.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between MDF and wood trim?",
    answer:
      "MDF (medium-density fiberboard) is more affordable, doesn't warp, and paints beautifully — ideal for painted trim. Solid wood (pine, oak, poplar) costs more but can be stained to show natural grain. We recommend MDF for most painted applications.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you match my existing trim style?",
    answer:
      "Usually, yes. We can match most standard profiles or have custom trim milled to match older or unique styles. Bring us a sample or photos and we'll find a solution.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does baseboard installation take?",
    answer:
      "A typical room takes 2-4 hours. A whole house (average 200 linear feet) usually takes 1-2 days including removing old baseboards, installation, and caulking.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you paint or stain the trim?",
    answer:
      "We can! We offer primed trim ready for paint, or we can paint/stain as part of the project. Many customers prefer pre-primed MDF that we install and then paint after caulking.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is coping and why does it matter?",
    answer:
      "Coping is a cutting technique for inside corners that creates tighter joints than simple miter cuts. As walls shift over time, coped joints stay tight while mitered joints can gap. We cope all inside corners for lasting results.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you add trim to a room that has none?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely! Adding baseboards, crown molding, and door/window casings transforms a basic room into a finished, polished space. It's one of the best value-add improvements for any home.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you install wainscoting?",
    answer:
      "Yes! We install all styles: beadboard, raised panel, flat panel, board and batten, and shiplap. Wainscoting adds character, protects walls, and increases home value.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle corners that aren't square?",
    answer:
      "Older homes often have out-of-square walls. We use techniques like back-cutting, scribing, and flexible caulk to achieve tight-fitting trim even on imperfect walls.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you build custom bookcases or built-ins?",
    answer:
      "Yes! We design and build custom shelving, bookcases, window seats, and entertainment centers. Built-ins maximize space and add significant value to your home.",

        Exquisite Finish Carpentry and Custom Millwork
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        While the foundational framing holds your house together, it is the
        meticulous detail of finish carpentry that truly transforms a basic
        structure into an elegant, highly personalized home. The precise
        installation of sophisticated crown molding, classic wainscoting,
        intricate baseboards, and beautiful custom cabinetry acts as the
        defining architectural signature of your interior spaces. At Madison
        Handyman Pro, we deliver exceptional, artisan-level finish carpentry
        services that add immediate, tangible financial value and profound
        visual depth to residential properties located throughout Madison,
        Huntsville, and the surrounding premier North Alabama neighborhoods.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Finish carpentry is a highly specialized, exacting discipline that
        absolutely demands an uncompromising eye for geometric perfection and
        years of patient, hands-on experience. Unlike rough framing, where a
        quarter-inch discrepancy can be easily hidden behind thick drywall,
        finish millwork is placed prominently on visual display. A poorly cut
        miter joint, a slightly misaligned casing, or an improperly coped inside
        corner will instantly draw the human eye, aggressively detracting from
        the perceived quality of the entire room. Our master carpenters uniquely
        treat every single linear foot of trim as a piece of fine furniture,
        executing flawless, microscopically tight joints that seamlessly blend
        into the overall architectural flow of your beautiful home.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 mt-14">
        Elevating Interior Aesthetics and Property Value
      </h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The strategic addition of high-quality architectural trim is universally
        recognized by leading real estate experts as one of the very few
        interior home improvement projects that consistently yields a
        substantial return on your initial financial investment. Upgrading from
        standard, narrow builder-grade baseboards to substantial, tall
        architectural profiles, or introducing elegant coffered ceilings into a
        stark, boring dining room, immediately establishes a powerful sense of
        permanence, premium luxury, and rich character. These seemingly minor
        architectural upgrades powerfully signal to prospective buyers and
        visiting guests alike that your property has been exceptionally cared
        for and thoughtfully designed.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-10">
        We approach every individual custom carpentry project with a holistic,
        design-oriented mindset. We actively consult with you to carefully
        select the perfect wood species, architectural styles, and precise
        dimensional proportions that harmoniously complement your home's
        specific era and your family's personal tastes. Whether you are seeking
        to faithfully restore historic, century-old true-wood trim to its former
        glory, or you are deeply looking to inject sleek, minimalist modern
        lines into a brand newly constructed home, our highly skilled team
        utilizes state-of-the-art precision tools alongside time-honored
        traditional woodworking techniques to absolutely guarantee an
        impeccable, stunning final result that you will proudly admire for
        decades.
