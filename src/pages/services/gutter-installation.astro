  {
    question: "How long do new gutters last?",
    answer:
      "Quality aluminum seamless gutters typically last 20-30+ years with proper maintenance. Factors affecting lifespan include material quality, installation technique, weather exposure, and regular cleaning. We use heavy-gauge aluminum and proper mounting techniques for maximum longevity.",
  },
  {
    question: "What size gutters do I need?",
    answer:
      "Most residential homes use 5-inch K-style gutters, which handle up to 1.2 gallons per foot. Homes with large roof areas, steep pitches, or heavy rainfall may benefit from 6-inch gutters. We'll assess your specific needs and recommend the appropriate size during your estimate.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does gutter installation cost?",
    answer:
      "Gutter installation costs vary based on linear footage, gutter style, home height, and complexity. Typical residential projects range from $1,000-$2,500 for a complete system. We provide free detailed estimates so you know exact costs before work begins.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you match my existing gutters?",
    answer:
      "Yes! We offer a wide range of colors and can match most existing gutter colors. If you're replacing damaged sections, we can often fabricate matching gutters on-site. We'll bring color samples during your estimate.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you install gutter guards?",
    answer:
      "We can discuss gutter guard options with you. While guards reduce debris, they're not maintenance-free and may not be ideal for all situations. We'll help you understand the pros and cons for your specific trees and roof setup.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does installation take?",
    answer:
      "Most residential gutter installations are completed in one day. A typical single-story home takes 4-6 hours, while larger or two-story homes may take a full day. We'll give you a time estimate with your quote.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will you repair my fascia boards?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Damaged or rotted fascia boards should be repaired before gutter installation for proper mounting. We inspect fascia during our assessment and include any necessary repairs in your estimate. Healthy fascia means secure gutters.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to my old gutters?",
    answer:
      "We remove and dispose of all old gutters, downspouts, and hardware. Everything is hauled away as part of the installation - you don't need to worry about disposal. We leave your property clean and ready.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you warranty your work?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we provide a workmanship warranty on all gutter installations. This covers installation defects, not normal wear or damage from impacts. We stand behind our work and will address any installation issues promptly.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I replace or repair my gutters?",
    answer:
      "Consider replacement if gutters are 15+ years old, have multiple leaking seams, show widespread rust/damage, or sag despite repairs. Isolated damage can often be repaired. During your estimate, we'll honestly assess whether repair or replacement makes more sense.",

        Premium Seamless Gutter Installation Services
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        A high-functioning, properly calibrated gutter system is arguably the
        most critical exterior component protecting the long-term structural
        integrity of your home. While often overlooked by homeowners until a
        catastrophic failure occurs, gutters perform the essential task of
        aggressively routing thousands of gallons of destructive rainwater
        safely away from your delicate foundation, expensive landscaping, and
        exterior siding. At Madison Handyman Pro, we specialize in the premium
        fabrication and precise installation of heavy-duty seamless aluminum
        gutters, actively safeguarding properties across Madison, Huntsville,
        and the broader North Alabama region against the severe consequences of
        chronic water damage.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        We exclusively install continuous, seamless gutter systems because
        outdated, sectional gutters pieced together with messy sealants are
        inherently prone to inevitable failure. Every single seam in a
        traditional gutter system represents a weak point where heavy water
        weight, thermal expansion, and accumulating debris will eventually cause
        highly destructive leaks. By custom-extruding your new gutters directly
        on-site at your home to the exact, precise measurements of your
        roofline, we completely eliminate these vulnerable joints. The result is
        a beautifully sleek, incredibly durable drainage system that
        effortlessly handles the torrential downpours characteristic of our
        unpredictable local Alabama climate.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 mt-14">
        Precision Pitching and Foundation Water Management
      </h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Hanging a gutter properly requires significantly more technical
        expertise than simply attaching a metal trough to a wooden fascia board.
        The true science of effective gutter installation lies in the precise
        calculation of the "pitch" or slope. If a gutter is hung perfectly
        level, standing water will stagnate, drastically accelerating the
        rusting or oxidation process while simultaneously creating a prime
        breeding ground for thousands of disease-carrying mosquitoes.
        Conversely, if it is pitched too steeply, the visual aesthetics of your
        roofline are jarringly ruined, and water may rapidly overrun the
        downspout capacity during heavy storms. Our highly trained technicians
        utilize advanced leveling tools to ensure the absolute perfect
        micro-pitch, silently and efficiently directing water precisely where it
        needs to go without compromising your home’s beautiful curb appeal.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-10">
        Beyond the gutters themselves, we comprehensively address the entire
        holistic water management system. We meticulously install oversized
        downspouts that drastically increase the overall water volume capacity
        by over 50% compared to standard builder-grade sizes, effectively
        preventing dangerous backlogs during torrential thunderstorms.
        Furthermore, we actively analyze where the water is being discharged at
        ground level, frequently implementing strategic underground routing
        solutions or extended splash blocks to guarantee that heavy moisture is
        driven far away from your concrete basement walls or sensitive
        crawlspace environment, thereby locking out the threat of foundational
        cracking and toxic mold infiltration.

            We bring our seamless gutter machine to your property and fabricate
            gutters on-site. This means perfect measurements, no delivery
            delays, and gutters cut to the exact length your home needs. No
            splicing, no extra seams, no compromises.

            Heavy-Gauge Aluminum
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">
            We use 0.027-inch aluminum, thicker than the industry standard
            0.025-inch material. This extra thickness provides better dent
            resistance, longer lifespan, and superior performance in Alabama's
            summer heat and winter freezes.

            Proper Slope and Drainage
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">
            Gutters must slope correctly toward downspouts for proper drainage.
            We carefully calculate and install the correct pitch, typically
            one-quarter inch per ten feet, ensuring water flows efficiently and
            never pools in your gutters.

            Hidden Hanger System
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">
            We install gutters using internal hidden hangers spaced every 24
            inches, providing secure mounting without visible hardware. This
            creates a cleaner appearance and stronger attachment than
            spike-and-ferrule systems that can loosen over time.
