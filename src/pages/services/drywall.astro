  {
    question: "How much does drywall repair cost?",

  },
  {
    question: "How long does drywall repair take?",
    answer:
      "Small patches can be completed in 1-2 hours. However, joint compound needs 24 hours to dry between coats, and most repairs need 2-3 coats. Plan for 2-3 days from start to paint-ready for best results.",

  {
    question: "Is drywall dust messy?",

  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to move my furniture?",

        Premium Drywall Repair and Installation Services
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        When it comes to maintaining the aesthetic and structural integrity of
        your home, having perfectly smooth, professionally finished drywall is
        absolutely essential. The walls and ceilings of your property represent
        the largest surface area in your home; consequently, even minor
        imperfections, settling cracks, or poorly executed patch jobs can
        dramatically detract from your home’s overall appearance and value. At
        Madison Handyman Pro, we specialize in delivering superior drywall
        services that range from patching small doorknob holes to executing
        expansive, multi-room drywall installations and ceiling restorations.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Drywall repair is notoriously difficult to get right. Unlike many basic
        DIY tasks, seamlessly blending new joint compound into an existing wall
        texture requires a highly skilled hand, years of specialized physical
        experience, and an eye for precise detail. Our dedicated team of local
        drywall technicians brings an exceptional level of craftsmanship to
        every single job. We take immense pride in our ability to execute
        "invisible" repairs—meaning that once our patched area is properly
        primed and painted, it will be completely undetectable, looking exactly
        like the original, undamaged wall.

        Water Damage Mitigation and Structural Restoration
      </h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Beyond simple cosmetic fixes, our reliable crew frequently handles
        complex restorative work stemming from plumbing leaks, roof failures,
        and severe weather events. When water infiltrates your home’s envelope,
        it rapidly compromises the gypsum core of your drywall, leading to
        structural weakening, unsightly brown staining, and the highly dangerous
        potential for toxic mold growth. In these critical situations, immediate
        and decisive professional intervention is required to safely remove the
        saturated materials, thoroughly dry the interior wall cavities, apply
        anti-microbial treatments if necessary, and systematically install
        fresh, moisture-resistant drywall boards.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-10">
        We approach every water damage scenario with strict adherence to
        industry best practices. We don’t just cover up the problem; we actively
        seek out the root cause to ensure our restorative drywall installation
        provides long-lasting, safe results for you and your family. By
        exclusively utilizing premium materials, high-quality joint tapes, and
        specially formulated setting-type compounds, we ensure that our repairs
        can withstand the natural structural shifting and seasonal humidity
        changes common to the local North Alabama environment.
