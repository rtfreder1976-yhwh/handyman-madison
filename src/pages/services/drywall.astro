const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How much does drywall repair cost?",
    answer: "Small repairs (nail holes, small cracks) typically run $75-150. Medium repairs (fist-sized holes) are $150-300. Large repairs or water damage restoration varies based on scope — we provide free estimates so you know exactly what to expect."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does drywall repair take?",
    answer: "Small patches can be completed in 1-2 hours. However, joint compound needs 24 hours to dry between coats, and most repairs need 2-3 coats. Plan for 2-3 days from start to paint-ready for best results."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you match my existing wall texture?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We're experienced with all common textures including orange peel, knockdown, smooth, skip trowel, and popcorn. We match your existing texture so repairs blend seamlessly."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you handle the painting too?",
    answer: "Yes! We offer painting services and can prime and paint repaired areas to match your existing walls. Ask about our drywall + painting packages for the best value."
  },
  {
    question: "Is drywall dust messy?",
    answer: "Drywall work does create dust, but we minimize it significantly. We use dust barriers, drop cloths, and vacuum with HEPA filters. We clean up thoroughly — you won't know we were there except for the beautiful repair."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to move my furniture?",
    answer: "We handle furniture moving and protection as part of our service. For large jobs, we may ask you to remove valuables and wall decorations beforehand."
  },
  {
    question: "What about mold behind water-damaged drywall?",
    answer: "We inspect for mold during water damage repairs. If found, we can coordinate with mold remediation specialists before installing new drywall. Your family's health comes first."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer emergency drywall repair?",
    answer: "Yes! For urgent situations like water damage or security issues (holes in exterior walls), we offer same-day and next-day emergency service. Call us directly for emergency scheduling."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you pull permits for drywall work?",
    answer: "Most drywall repairs don't require permits. For larger projects involving structural changes or additions, we'll advise you on permit requirements and can assist with the process."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between drywall and sheetrock?",
    answer: "Sheetrock is a brand name for drywall — like Kleenex is to tissues. We work with all drywall types and brands, using the best materials for your specific project."
