const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How much does flooring installation cost?",
    answer:
      "Flooring costs vary by material and room size. Laminate runs $3-8/sq ft installed, LVP $4-10/sq ft, and hardwood $8-15/sq ft. A typical 300 sq ft room ranges from $900-4,500 depending on material. We provide free detailed estimates.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does flooring installation take?",
    answer:
      "A single room (up to 300 sq ft) typically takes 1 day. Larger areas or whole-house installations take 2-5 days. Hardwood refinishing requires 3-5 days including drying time. We'll give you a specific timeline with your estimate.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to move my furniture?",
    answer:
      "We handle furniture moving as part of our service. We'll move items out, install flooring, and move them back. For large or delicate items, we may ask you to empty the room beforehand. We use furniture pads to protect everything.",
  },
  {
    question: "What flooring is best for kitchens and bathrooms?",
    answer:
      "Waterproof options are essential: LVP (luxury vinyl plank) or sheet vinyl. We don't recommend hardwood or laminate in wet areas. LVP is our top recommendation — it's waterproof, durable, and looks like real wood.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you install flooring over existing flooring?",
    answer:
      "Sometimes. Floating floors (laminate, LVP) can often go over existing hard surfaces if they're flat and in good condition. However, installing over old flooring can raise floor height and affect doors/transitions. We'll advise on the best approach.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I care for new hardwood floors?",
    answer:
      "Sweep or vacuum regularly (use soft settings). Damp mop occasionally with hardwood cleaner — never wet mop. Use furniture pads under legs. Maintain consistent humidity (35-55%). Avoid high heels and pet nail scratches. Refinish every 7-10 years.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between LVP and laminate?",
    answer:
      "LVP (luxury vinyl plank) is 100% waterproof and more durable — great for any room including bathrooms. Laminate has a wood-fiber core that swells when wet — avoid in kitchens/baths. LVP is slightly more expensive but worth it for versatility.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you remove and dispose of old flooring?",
    answer:
      "Yes, old flooring removal and disposal is included in our service. We remove laminate, vinyl, and old flooring materials and haul them away. Hardwood removal is more involved and priced separately if needed.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long should flooring acclimate before installation?",
    answer:
      "Most flooring should acclimate 48-72 hours in the room where it will be installed. This allows the material to adjust to your home's temperature and humidity, preventing expansion issues after installation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you match existing flooring for repairs?",
    answer:
      "We do our best to match existing flooring. For common products, we can often find exact matches. For discontinued or older flooring, we'll find the closest match available. Sometimes creative transitions between old and new look best.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer emergency flooring service?",
    answer:
      "Yes! For water damage situations where flooring needs immediate removal to prevent mold, we offer same-day and next-day emergency service. Call us directly for urgent flooring issues.",
  },
  {
    question: "What subfloor preparation is needed?",
    answer:
      "We inspect and prep subfloors as part of every installation. This may include leveling with compound, replacing damaged sections, adding moisture barriers, or installing underlayment. Proper prep is key to flooring that lasts.",

        Expert Flooring Installation and Repair Services
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Your flooring is quite literally the foundation of your home's interior
        design and daily functionality. It sets the overarching aesthetic tone
        for every room while silently enduring the relentless daily traffic of
        family members, playful children, and active pets. Attempting to install
        or repair hardwood, laminate, tile, or luxury vinyl plank (LVP) without
        a high degree of professional experience often leads to disastrous
        results—including unsightly gaps, irritating squeaks, uneven surfaces,
        and a drastically reduced material lifespan. At Madison Handyman Pro, we
        deliver precision-driven flooring services that elevate the structural
        quality and visual appeal of homes throughout Madison and the
        surrounding North Alabama region.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Modern flooring systems, especially waterproof click-lock LVP and
        engineered hardwoods, require incredibly meticulous subfloor preparation
        before a single plank is ever laid. An uneven concrete slab or a
        significantly damaged plywood subfloor will quickly telegraph
        imperfections upward, compromising the integrity of your costly new
        investment. Our dedicated team of specialized flooring technicians
        meticulously assesses, completely levels, and thoroughly prepares your
        underlying foundation, ensuring a permanently flawless end result that
        feels remarkably solid underfoot. We refuse to cut corners, guaranteeing
        that your new floors are installed strictly according to the original
        manufacturer's stringent specifications.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 mt-14">
        Comprehensive Subfloor Repair and Water Remediation
      </h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Beyond simple aesthetic upgrades, our reliable crews frequently handle
        complex restorative flooring work stemming directly from undetected
        plumbing leaks, severe appliance overflow accidents, and seasonal
        foundation moisture. When standing water stealthily infiltrates beneath
        your visible floorboards, it inevitably leads to the rapid buckling of
        delicate hardwoods, the destructive delamination of under-layers, and
        the hidden, dangerous proliferation of toxic subfloor mold. In these
        highly stressful situations, immediate professional intervention is
        absolutely critical to remove the saturated materials before structural
        rot occurs.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-10">
        We approach every single subfloor repair scenario with strict,
        unwavering adherence to modern industry best practices. From expertly
        replacing rotting joists and installing robust new plywood decking, to
        strategically applying moisture barriers specifically rated for the
        Alabama climate, we comprehensively reconstruct your floor from the
        ground up. By exclusively utilizing premium installation materials, we
        ensure that your restored flooring system will beautifully withstand
        natural structural shifting, heavy daily wear, and environmental
        challenges for decades to come, bringing you lasting peace of mind.
