Your home’s exterior doors are the absolute first line of defense against the unpredictable North Alabama weather and uninvited intruders. When an exterior door suddenly breaks, won’t shut properly, or the locking mechanism completely fails, it instantly escalates from a minor annoyance into a massive, stressful home security emergency. 

Whether it was violently swung open by a massive gust of wind destroying the hinges, or extreme humidity has suddenly swelled the wooden frame so tightly you can't engage the deadbolt, homeowners in Harvest need to know how to diagnose the issue, temporarily secure the house, and exactly when to call a professional. 

## The Most Common Exterior Door Emergencies 

### 1. The Door Will Not Latch or Lock
You go to shut the door for the night, turn the deadbolt, and it simply won’t engage the metal strike plate on the wall frame. You’re exposed. 
*   **The Cause:** In Alabama, radical shifts in seasonal humidity cause wooden door jambs (the frame) and solid wood doors to swell and shrink dramatically. Alternatively, sheer home foundation settling has slightly skewed the geometry of the door frame, throwing the lock out of alignment. 
*   **The Temporary Fix:** Do not brute-force or slam the deadbolt handle. You will snap the delicate internal mechanism in half. Instead, push hard or pull tight on the doorknob while slowly turning the deadbolt to see if you can force alignment. Otherwise, you may have to rely on a secondary lock, security bar, or chain lock for the evening. 

### 2. The Hinges Have Pulled Out of the Frame
A heavy wind caught the door as you opened it, or someone threw their weight against it, and the screws holding the heavy metal hinge into the wooden frame violently stripped out. The door is now severely sagging and dragging on the floor. 
*   **The Cause:** Often, the original builders utilized cheap, half-inch screws that barely scratched the surface of the door frame. The sheer weight of a solid core exterior door effortlessly grinds those tiny screws out of the wood over time. 
*   **The Temporary Fix:** Try to prop a wedge or a book underneath the sagging corner of the door to take the immense gravitational pressure off the last remaining hinge until it can be repaired. 

### 3. Glass Breakage
Whether from a stray baseball, a brutal hailstorm, or an attempted break-in, shattered glass on a french door, a sliding patio door, or a decorative front door window demands immediate action. 
*   **The Cause:** Impact. 
*   **The Temporary Fix:** Carefully sweep up the interior glass wearing heavy leather gloves and boots. Tape a heavy piece of cardboard or a thick trash bag completely across the gap on both the inside and outside of the door to block the weather and maintain your home's air conditioning perimeter. 

## How a Professional Fixes The Problem

A door emergency is one of the few repairs that genuinely cannot wait until next week. An un-lockable home is unacceptable. When a professional arrives to make a permanent repair, here is how they tackle the core issues. 

### Fixing Sinking Hinges & Stripped Wood
A master handyman will remove the tiny, stripped screws from the door frame completely. They will permanently plug the stripped holes using wood glue and solid dowels (or golf tees in a pinch!). Once the glue is cured, they will re-hang the door utilizing massive **3-inch to 4-inch heavy-duty screws**. These massive screws reach straight through the weak decorative door jamb wood and bury themselves deep into the structural 2x4 framing studs of your house, ensuring that the door will literally never sag again. 

### Re-Aligning the Strike Plates
If the door has shifted from home settling and the lock no longer aligns, a professional will utilize a Dremel tool, a sharp wood chisel, or a specialized metal file. They will literally carve out and expand the hole in the metal strike plate or the wooden frame by mere fractions of a millimeter—just enough so the deadbolt smoothly and flawlessly glides into place with a single finger turn. 

### Permanent Weatherproofing
During a repair, a professional assesses the weatherstripping. By installing heavy-duty door sweeps beneath the door and aggressive foam weatherstripping along the sides, they completely seal the perimeter, stopping drafts, saving you hundreds on electricity, and preventing rainwater from destroying your subfloor.
